A project to design, build and program a robot using a PIXY cam and the Ultimate 2.0 robotics kit. 

A first year project completed by Adam Duke, Michael Codd & Ronan Carroll at Maynooth University. 
Using a PIXY Cam and a modified Arduino board, we found a method to marry the two systems and allow the 
PIXY cam to talk to the Arduino and therefore allow it to operate as the primary data input for the robot.

The objective of the project was for the robot to navigate an arena and pick up balls of a certain colour and 
carry them to an end-zone.
