A project to design, build and program a robot using computer vision and the Ultimate 2.0 robotics kit. 

A first year project completed by Adam Duke, Michael Codd & Ronan Carroll at Maynooth University. 
Using a PIXY Cam and a modified Arduino board, we found a method to marry the two systems and allow the 
PIXY cam to talk to the Arduino and therefore allow it to operate as the primary data input for the robot.
